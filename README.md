# camelsp

This repo helps processing the data dumps received from the authorities. 

It is important to install the package locally and with editable flag:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:camels-de/camelsp
cd camelsp
pip install -e .

# then wget the data into the input data folder
cd input_data
wget https://bwsyncarndshare.kit.edu/s/<SHARE_TOKEN>/download
```

On https://hub.camels-de.org, the installation can be skipped

## Scripts

Functions for handling one state specifically are located in the respective subbmodule,
utility functions helpful for all states are imported at top-level

Help scripts indicating the usage for possible re-processing are located at the top-level
`scripts` folder.

## NUTS

We use nuts2 codes to derive ids and to build a folder structure. There is a case-insensitve utility function
for looking up the top level 2 NUTS codes in the package, which should accept many existing abbreviations:

```python
from camelsp import nuts3

nuts('Ba-WÃ¼')                  # gives DE1
nuts('NRW')                    # gives DEA
nuts('Pfalz')                  # gives DEB
nuts('mecklenburg Vorpommern') # gives DE8
```
